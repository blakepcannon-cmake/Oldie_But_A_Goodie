Some old scripts from long ago

First, we have a median polish written in R. My colleague, Sean Bowman, brought the idea to conduct a [median polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_polish) for some added analytical rigor to a marketing research project we conducted at Decision Development, Inc. 

Second, a script that helped me personally to more effectively "see" a probability concept I couldn't wrap by head around. This script helped me, and a few others I showed it to, see a more empirical view of the [Monty Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) problem.
